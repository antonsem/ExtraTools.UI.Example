# ExtraTools.UI.Example
An example usage of the ExtraTools.UI package

I was about to write a very nice readme file and a long blog post about it. But Unity made an oopsie, and I decided to abandon the engine forever. Still, if you think this system might be useful, feel free to check the package over here: https://github.com/antonsem/ExtraTools.UI.
